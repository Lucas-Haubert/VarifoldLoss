# The Varifold Loss: A Geometrical Approach to Loss Functions for Deep Learning Time Series Forecasting


## Overview

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of the Varifold Loss, a shape-based loss function for training deep neural networks to perform time series forecasting. It aims at providing an easy-to-use pipeline where datasets, models, or loss functions can be easily swapped, with a particular emphasis on the latter.

This work is the result of my Master's Thesis for the MVA Master's program at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, within the Signal Processing team at the [Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).


## Usage

1. Install PyTorch and the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download the data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPz3pVgydOBUcxl9U0tVTTiScj12IQNc?usp=drive_link), then store it in the folder `./dataset`.
