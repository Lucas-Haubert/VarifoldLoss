# FlexForecast

Flexible Deep Learning Time Series Forecasting framework.

At this time, I am reproducing the experiments of the iTransformer repository (https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer/tree/main) from the server Ruche, I launched one baby experiment (1 epoch, run.py). 

Next step: Adapt the code to change the losses and the metrics, from standard to shape based ones.
