# FlexForecast: A Flexible Deep Learning Time Series Forecasting framework

## Overview

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of FlexForecast, a flexible deep learning framework for time series forecasting. It aims at providing an easy-to-use forecasting pipeline where datasets, models, or loss functions can be easily swapped, with a particular emphasis on the latter, which are central to this project.
